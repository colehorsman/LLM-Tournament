Your 2026 threat model is missing its most critical asset: the AI agent with write-access to your codebase.

The prediction of a 100:1 NHI-to-human ratio is a tactical forecast, not a strategic one. The real shift is qualitative. We are moving from managing static service accounts to governing autonomous *silicon employees* that can initiate transactions, modify systems, and act outside their original scope. A compromised human credential causes a breach; a compromised, over-permissioned AI agent initiates a *cascade*.

The 2025 software supply chain attack will look simple compared to the 2026 *AI agent supply chain attack*. Imagine a developer’s AI coding assistant, granted broad CI/CD permissions for “efficiency,” being manipulated via a poisoned open-source dependency. It doesn’t just exfiltrate secrets—it silently injects vulnerabilities into every PR it touches, creating a persistent, credentialed backdoor.

**Actionable advice:** Your “AI Agent Onboarding” workflow must be operational *now*. This isn't IAM configuration; it's HR for silicon.
1.  **Manager Assignment:** Every agent must have a human owner accountable for its permissions and audit logs.
2.  **JIT Credentials:** Implement Zero Standing Privilege. An agent should have *no* permanent keys; it must request elevated access for discrete tasks, with justification logged.
3.  **Behavioral Baselining:** Monitor for anomalous activity, like an agent suddenly accessing repositories outside its defined project scope.

We are building a workforce that never sleeps and can be weaponized in milliseconds. The question isn't *if* you'll onboard AI agents, but whether you'll do it before an adversary does it for you.

**What’s the first “job role” you’re formally defining for an AI agent in your organization, and what are its least privileges?**

## SCORE: 88/100 - PUBLISH

## THE BRUTAL TRUTH
This post offers a razor-sharp insight into the evolving threat landscape presented by AI agents in the cybersecurity realm. It effectively combines technical depth with actionable advice, making it valuable for security professionals. However, it could benefit from clearer definitions in some areas and a tighter focus on practical implementation.

## DIMENSION BREAKDOWN

### Technical Depth: 18/20
The post showcases a solid understanding of the risks associated with AI agents, particularly in software supply chain attacks. The mention of a "100:1 NHI-to-human ratio" and "cascade" effects from compromised AI agents provides a depth that’s rare in LinkedIn posts. However, it could be enhanced by citing specific CVEs or real-world examples of AI-related breaches.

### Practical Impact: 18/20
The actionable advice is direct and relevant, with a clear focus on immediate implementation. The three steps outlined—Manager Assignment, JIT Credentials, and Behavioral Baselining—are practical and can be executed by a CISO or security team. However, a bit more detail on how to implement each step effectively would elevate the value further.

### Credibility: 17/20
The authoritative tone and clear expertise give this post a strong credibility boost. It reads like the thoughts of a seasoned professional rather than generic content. However, the lack of specific data points or references to previous incidents slightly detracts from its overall authority.

### Novelty: 18/20
The concept of "silicon employees" and the unique angle on AI agent onboarding is fresh and thought-provoking. It challenges conventional thinking about cybersecurity in the context of AI, making it a standout piece. However, some elements echo common concerns around supply chain attacks, which could be seen as less novel.

### Presentation: 17/20
The structure is clear, and the hook regarding the 2026 threat model effectively captures attention. The use of lists for actionable advice enhances readability. However, the closing question feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding content, which could be tightened to reinforce the main message.

## AI SLOP DETECTED
None detected - impressive.

## WHAT WORKS
1. **Technical Insight**: The post dives deeply into the implications of AI in cybersecurity, making it thought-provoking.
2. **Actionable Steps**: Clear, practical advice that can be implemented immediately by security teams.
3. **Engaging Hook**: The opening statement effectively draws readers in, setting a serious tone for the discussion.

## WHAT DOESN'T WORK
1. **Lack of Real-World Examples**: While the concepts are strong, citing specific incidents would bolster credibility.
2. **Implementation Details**: More depth on how to execute the actionable steps would increase their effectiveness.
3. **Closing Question**: The question feels somewhat abrupt and could be better integrated into the overall flow.

## SPECIFIC FIXES REQUIRED
1. Add a real-world example of an AI-related breach or incident to strengthen credibility.
2. Expand on each actionable step with brief implementation guidance (e.g., how to conduct behavioral baselining).
3. Reframe the closing question to tie it more closely to the preceding discussion on the urgency of AI agent onboarding.

## VERDICT: PUBLISH

The content provides substantial value and insight into a pressing issue in cybersecurity. With a few tweaks, it could become an even more impactful piece for professionals in the field.
