**Your 2026 Attack Surface: 100 Machines for Every Human**

By 2026, non-human identities (NHIs) will explode to a 100:1 ratio compared to human employees in cloud-native enterprises. For those embracing AI agents, expect a staggering 500:1 ratio. This isn't a distant threat; it's the reality we're building today.

My insight? Traditional Identity and Access Management (IAM) is fundamentally broken in this new world. We need to shift from managing *users* to governing *machine-to-machine* relationships. The SolarWinds and CircleCI breaches taught us that compromised identities, even non-human ones, are prime vectors for lateral movement.

The critical move is implementing **attribute-based access control (ABAC)** policies, specifically tailored for NHIs. Forget role-based access; think granular permissions based on context, data sensitivity, and real-time risk assessments. Start by auditing your cloud environments for orphaned service accounts and overly permissive API keys.

Are you prepared to secure an environment where machines are the dominant players, and legacy IAM is a relic of the past? What steps are you taking *now* to prepare for the coming NHI explosion?

## SCORE: 85/100 - PUBLISH

## THE BRUTAL TRUTH
This post demonstrates a solid grasp of the evolving threat landscape and presents actionable advice backed by real-world examples. However, it could benefit from a more robust technical foundation and a clearer structure in certain areas. Overall, it’s a commendable effort worthy of sharing.

## DIMENSION BREAKDOWN

### Technical Depth: 16/20
The post touches on crucial technical aspects, such as the upcoming 100:1 ratio of non-human identities (NHIs) and the mention of **attribute-based access control (ABAC)** policies. However, it lacks specific CVEs or detailed attack vectors that would elevate it to a higher score. The references to SolarWinds and CircleCI breaches provide context but could be expanded with more specific lessons learned or technical details about how these breaches exploited IAM weaknesses.

### Practical Impact: 17/20
The advice is actionable, particularly the call to audit cloud environments for orphaned service accounts and overly permissive API keys. However, it could be improved with a more detailed step-by-step guide on how to implement ABAC policies effectively. While the advice is solid, it lacks explicit next steps for a CISO to take immediately.

### Credibility: 18/20
The post's tone suggests an experienced professional, especially with references to specific breaches and a clear understanding of IAM challenges. The insights feel credible and backed by real-world scenarios, positioning the author as knowledgeable in the field.

### Novelty: 15/20
While the post offers fresh insights into the ratio of NHIs to human employees and the need for a shift in IAM strategies, the concepts themselves (such as moving from role-based to attribute-based access control) are not entirely new. The framing of NHIs as a growing threat provides a novel angle, but there’s potential for more innovative ideas or solutions.

### Presentation: 19/20
The hook, “Your 2026 Attack Surface: 100 Machines for Every Human,” is compelling and immediately captures attention. The structure is logical and flows well, making it easy to follow. The rhetorical question at the end serves to engage the reader, although it could be seen as slightly redundant.

## AI SLOP DETECTED

- None detected - impressive.

## WHAT WORKS
1. Strong hook that captures attention and sets the stage for the discussion.
2. Actionable advice that can lead to immediate improvements in security posture.
3. Credible insights based on real-world breaches, enhancing the post's authority.

## WHAT DOESN'T WORK
1. Lack of specific technical details or examples that could elevate the post's depth.
2. The advice, while actionable, could be more detailed to provide clearer next steps.
3. Some concepts, while relevant, feel somewhat recycled and could use a fresher perspective.

## SPECIFIC FIXES REQUIRED
1. Expand on the SolarWinds and CircleCI breaches with specific technical details or lessons learned.
2. Include a more comprehensive step-by-step guide for implementing ABAC policies.
3. Introduce at least one novel idea or innovative solution related to NHIs or IAM to enhance the post's uniqueness.

## VERDICT: PUBLISH

This post is a strong contender for publication, offering valuable insights and actionable advice. With minor adjustments to deepen technical content and expand on implementation strategies, it could become a standout piece in the cybersecurity discourse.
