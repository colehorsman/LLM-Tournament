Here's a LinkedIn post draft focusing on the rise of Non-Human Identities:

**Subject: 2026: Are You Ready for the NHI Tsunami?**

Remember the BYOD craze? Get ready for something far more disruptive: the explosion of Non-Human Identities (NHIs). My prediction? By 2026, cloud-native enterprises will see NHIs outnumber humans by a staggering 100:1. For organizations heavily invested in AI agents, that ratio could skyrocket to 500:1.

Think about it: AI agents, service accounts, APIs, serverless functions – all demanding access, all creating potential attack vectors. Traditional IAM simply wasn't built to handle this scale. We're talking about a completely new identity perimeter.

The implications are massive. Imagine the blast radius of a compromised AI agent with overly permissive access. We're not just talking data breaches; we're talking potential operational disruption, supply chain vulnerabilities, and even physical security risks.

**Here’s what you need to do, *now*:**

*   **Inventory and Prioritize:** Identify every NHI in your environment. Understand their privileges and access patterns. Focus on the highest-risk identities first.
*   **Implement Granular Controls:** Ditch the broad-brush permissions. Adopt a Zero Standing Privilege (ZSP) model for NHIs. This will be table stakes for security audits and cyber insurance soon enough.
*   **Onboard Like Humans:** Treat AI agents like employees. Formalize "AI Agent Onboarding" processes with identity provisioning, behavioral baselines, and termination procedures.

The NHI tsunami is coming. Are you prepared to ride the wave, or will you be swept away? What innovative strategies are you exploring to manage the burgeoning world of non-human identities? Let's discuss! #IdentitySecurity #AIsecurity #CIEM #ZeroTrust #Cybersecurity

## SCORE: 68/100 - REVISE

## THE BRUTAL TRUTH
This post showcases a promising topic about Non-Human Identities but ultimately falters due to a lack of technical depth and a reliance on vague advice. While there are actionable steps, they lack the specificity that a seasoned CISO would demand. The "tsunami" metaphor is overused and detracts from the seriousness of the subject matter.

## DIMENSION BREAKDOWN

### Technical Depth: 14/20
The post does touch on relevant concepts such as AI agents, service accounts, and Zero Standing Privilege (ZSP), which shows a good grasp of the topic. However, it misses the chance to mention specific CVEs or detailed implementation strategies for ZSP. For example, stating "Ditch the broad-brush permissions" without elaborating on how to implement granular controls weakens the technical rigor.

### Practical Impact: 12/20
While there are some actionable steps, they are somewhat generic and lack depth. For instance, "Identify every NHI in your environment" is a good start, but what tools or methodologies should be used? The advice to "adopt a Zero Standing Privilege (ZSP) model" is a buzzword in itself without a clear action plan on how to achieve this effectively.

### Credibility: 15/20
The author demonstrates some authority by discussing NHIs and predicting their rise. However, phrases like "the blast radius of a compromised AI agent" come off as alarmist without data to back it up. It reads like a thoughtful piece from someone with experience but lacks the gravitas of a battle-scarred veteran.

### Novelty: 14/20
The concept of NHIs is relatively fresh, but the framing of a "tsunami" feels clichéd and detracts from the novelty. While the topic is timely, the insights provided are not groundbreaking and could use a more unique angle to stand out in a crowded field.

### Presentation: 13/20
The hook, "Are You Ready for the NHI Tsunami?" is engaging but overly sensational. The structure is decent, with clear points laid out, but the call to action at the end feels like filler rather than a strong closing statement. Additionally, the use of "Let’s discuss!" is a weak ending that doesn’t provide a strong takeaway.

## AI SLOP DETECTED
- **GENERIC OPENINGS**: "Get ready for something far more disruptive..."
- **BUZZWORD SOUP**: "Zero Standing Privilege" (ZSP) without specifics on implementation.
- **VAGUE ADVICE**: "Identify every NHI in your environment" (lacks tools or methods).
- **FEAR MONGERING**: "Imagine the blast radius of a compromised AI agent" (no data or examples).
- **FORMAT CRIMES**: 4 hashtags present.

## WHAT WORKS
1. The post identifies a relevant and emerging topic in cybersecurity.
2. The structure is logical and allows for easy reading.
3. Actionable points are provided, albeit they need more depth.

## WHAT DOESN'T WORK
1. The content relies on buzzwords and vague advice, lacking actionable specifics.
2. The metaphor of a "tsunami" is overused and detracts from the seriousness of the message.
3. There is insufficient technical depth to satisfy a seasoned audience.

## SPECIFIC FIXES REQUIRED
1. Change "Ditch the broad-brush permissions" to "Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) to limit permissions based on specific job functions."
2. Expand on "Identify every NHI" by suggesting specific tools like identity governance platforms or audits.
3. Remove the metaphor "NHI tsunami" and replace it with a more straightforward phrase like "rise of Non-Human Identities."
4. Strengthen the closing statement to provide a clear call to action or summary of key points.

## VERDICT: REVISE

The post has potential, but it needs significant work to be truly impactful and actionable for a cybersecurity audience. Focus on delivering concrete examples and practical advice that reflect real-world applications.
