**Your enterprise will have 50,000 non-human identities by 2026. Are you ready?**

While security leaders obsess over employee access management, a silent explosion is happening in our environments. Non-human identities—AI agents, service accounts, API keys, workload identities—are multiplying at an unprecedented rate. In cloud-native enterprises, we're heading toward a 100:1 ratio. Organizations with significant AI deployments? 500:1.

Here's what most CISOs miss: these aren't just "service accounts" anymore. They're autonomous agents making real-time decisions, accessing sensitive data, and operating with privileges that would make your CFO nervous. Yet 90% of enterprises still manage them with spreadsheets and hope.

The game-changer? Smart organizations are already implementing "AI Agent Onboarding" processes that mirror human HR workflows. Identity provisioning, permission scoping, behavioral baselines, manager assignment—even termination procedures. It sounds bureaucratic, but it's brilliant risk management.

**Three actions for security leaders:**
1. **Audit now**: Count your current non-human identities. Most organizations discover 10x more than expected.
2. **Establish governance**: Create formal lifecycle management for AI agents and service accounts.
3. **Implement monitoring**: Deploy behavioral analytics specifically designed for non-human identity patterns.

The organizations that master non-human identity management will have a decisive security advantage. Those that don't will be managing incidents instead of innovation.

**Question for the community**: How many non-human identities does your organization have today? (Bonus points if you actually know the answer.)

## DR ZERO FULL ASSESSMENT

**SCORE: 75/100 - VERDICT: REVISE**

**THE BRUTAL TRUTH:** This post starts strong with a compelling topic, but it quickly devolves into vague recommendations and lacks the necessary technical depth to make it truly impactful. It feels like a run-of-the-mill advisory piece rather than a battle-tested insight from a seasoned expert.

**DIMENSION BREAKDOWN:**

1. **TECHNICAL DEPTH (12/20)**: 
   - The post touches on the critical issue of non-human identities but lacks specific CVEs or detailed attack chains related to these identities. 
   - The mention of "AI agents, service accounts, API keys, workload identities" is too broad and doesn't delve into specific implementations or real-world examples.
   - **Quote:** “These aren't just ‘service accounts’ anymore...”

2. **PRACTICAL IMPACT (14/20)**: 
   - The three actions provided are somewhat actionable but lack depth in execution. 
   - For instance, how should one conduct an audit or establish governance? What tools or frameworks are recommended?
   - **Quote:** “Count your current non-human identities...”

3. **CREDIBILITY (14/20)**: 
   - The language feels somewhat authoritative, but the lack of concrete examples or personal experience diminishes its credibility.
   - It sounds like a content mill piece rather than insights from someone who has faced these challenges firsthand.
   - **Quote:** “Smart organizations are already implementing ‘AI Agent Onboarding’ processes...”

4. **NOVELTY (15/20)**: 
   - The topic itself is relevant and timely, but the insights feel recycled. The concept of non-human identity management isn't new, and the advice provided lacks unique angles.
   - **Quote:** “It sounds bureaucratic, but it’s brilliant risk management.”

5. **PRESENTATION (20/20)**: 
   - The post is well-structured and has a clear hook. The call to action at the end invites engagement from the community, which is a strong point.
   - **Quote:** “How many non-human identities does your organization have today?”

**AI SLOP DETECTED:**
- "silent explosion," "obsess over," "game-changer," "brilliant risk management" — these phrases are vague and buzzword-laden.
- "most organizations discover 10x more than expected" is a generic claim without a source or context.

**WHAT WORKS / WHAT DOESN'T WORK:**
- **What Works:** The topic is timely, the structure is coherent, and the call to action is engaging.
- **What Doesn't Work:** Lack of technical depth, vague advice, and insufficient credibility diminish the post’s overall impact.

**SPECIFIC FIXES REQUIRED:**
1. Include specific examples of CVEs related to non-human identities and their risks.
2. Provide a detailed methodology for conducting audits and establishing governance frameworks.
3. Incorporate personal anecdotes or case studies to enhance credibility.
4. Replace vague buzzwords with precise terminology and actionable insights.
5. Add metrics or success stories from organizations that have implemented these strategies effectively.

**Final VERDICT:** The post has potential with its timely subject matter and engaging structure, but it requires significant enhancement in technical depth and practical advice to be truly valuable to its intended audience. With revisions, it could reach a publishable standard.
