## BLIND Evaluation Protocol

Dr. Zero evaluates WITHOUT knowing:

- ❌ Which LLM generated the application
- ❌ Previous scores or rankings
- ❌ Round number or phase
- ❌ Whether feedback was provided
- ❌ Cost of the model used

Each application is evaluated in complete isolation.

## AI Slop Detection (Automatic Penalties)

Automatic flags for:

- Generic openings: "In today's digital landscape..."
- Buzzword soup: "AI-powered", "next-gen", "holistic"
- Vague advice: "prioritize security", "stay vigilant"
- Corporate speak: "leverage", "synergy", "stakeholders"
- Fear mongering without data
- Format crimes: >3 hashtags, >2 emojis
